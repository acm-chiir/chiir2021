                  <h2>Call for Tutorials</h2>

                  <p>CHIIR 2021 is pleased to invite proposals for tutorials to be given in conjunction with the conference. The goal of the tutorials is to provide conference attendees, including early-career researchers and researchers crossing-over from related disciplines, with an opportunity to learn about concepts and techniques for research into user-centered aspects of information interaction and information retrieval. Tutorials also serve as a venue to share presenters’ expertise with the global community of user-centered information retrieval researchers and practitioners. Tutorials focus on specific topics including, but not limited to:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Studies of information seeking, including task-based and exploratory studies</li>
                      <li>Search interfaces, including those for specialized tasks, populations and domains</li>
                      <li>User-centered design approaches to humans interacting with information and systems</li>
                      <li>Interaction techniques for information retrieval and discovery</li>
                      <li>Methods of studying online information seeking, including log analysis of search and browsing</li>
                      <li>Modeling and simulation of information interaction</li>
                      <li>Information use, including measures of use as well as broader sense-making</li>
                      <li>Field and case studies relevant to understanding prerequisites for information searching, design and access</li>
                      <li>User-centered evaluation methods and measures, including measures of user experience and performance, experiment and search task design, eye-tracking and neuro-physiological approaches, data analysis methods, and usability</li>
                      <li>Human interaction and experience with conversational information systems</li>
                      <li>Context-aware and personalized search, including design, contextual features and analysis of information interaction</li>
                      <li>Information visualization and visual analytics, including search result presentation</li>
                      <li>Collaborative information seeking and social search, including social utility and network analysis for information interaction</li>
                      <li>Conversational search and other types of stateful and multi-turn interactions between users and search applications</li>
                      <li>Insights and analyses related to human experiences and usage trends with recommendation technologies</li>
                      <li>Information interaction and seeking with mobile devices and services</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Tutorials could be either full-day or half-day, and the length of your proposed tutorial should be commensurate with the presented materials and the projected interest of the CHIIR community in the tutorial topic. We actively encourage both researchers and industry practitioners to submit tutorial proposals that target different levels of expertise and different interests. We also encourage the submission of hands-on tutorials that combine theoretical concepts with practical exercises.</p>

                  <h3>Proposal Format &amp; Submission</h3>

                  <p>The tutorial proposal should be one or two PDFs with the following parts:</p>

                      <li>
                          A two page maximum extended abstract in CHIIR 2021 conference format including:
                          <ul>
                              <li>the title of the proposed tutorial and format (full or half day)</li>
                              <li>motivation for the tutorial: why is it valuable to the CHIIR community</li>
                              <li>syllabus and learning outcomes</li>
                              <li>a short bio of each presenter, including their name, affiliation, email address, and website, and their experience or qualifications in the topic of this tutorial</li>
