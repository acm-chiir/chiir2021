                  <h3>Tutorials</h3>

                  <h4>User Models, Metrics and Measures of Search: A Tutorial on the CWL  Evaluation Framework</h4>
                  <ul>
 						<li>Leif Azzopardi (University of Strathclyde)</li>
 						<li>Alistair Moffat (The University of Melbourne)</li>
 						<li>Paul Thomas (Microsoft)</li>
 						<li>Guido Zuccon (The University of Queensland)</li>
 					</ul>

                  <p>
                  	Evaluation is central to Information Retrieval, and is how we compare the quality of systems.  One important principle of evaluation is that the measured score should reflect the user's experience with the system, and hence, conversely, that there should be a connection between the way that the system's users are modeled as behaving, and the characteristics of the metric.  In this tutorial we will introduce the CWL approach to user modelling, and describe the recent approaches to evaluation that it has facilitated.  The tutorial will be presented as a mix of live-to-camera presentation, recorded in-depth videos, and hands-on activities using the CWL toolkit for your own evaluation tasks. A followup consultation session will also be provided, to allow extended questions and individual discussion with the four presenters.</p>

                   <h4>Between Rigour and Ethics in Studies Involving Participants With Disabilities: A Tutorial</h4>
                  <ul>
 						<li>Gerd Berget (Oslo Metropolitan University)</li>
 						<li>Andrew MacFarlane (City, University of London)</li>
 					</ul>

                  <p>
                  	Research is conducted within the field of interactive information retrieval on a broad diversity of users, with more interest recently in working with minority groups, such as people with disabilities. The tutorial addresses best practice when conducting research on cohorts that might be regarded as “vulnerable participants”. Previous research has showed that rigorous experiments for all types of users can be difficult, and there are many issues to be raised with regard to the tension between rigor and ethics. The tutorial examines these issues by engaging attendees with particular groups using scenarios and personas.</p>

                  	<h4>The PhD Journey: Reaching Out and Lending a Hand</h4>
                  <ul>
 						<li>Johanne R. Trippas (University of Melbourne)</li>
 						<li>David Maxwell (Delft University of Technology)</li>
 					</ul>

                  <p>
                  	A PhD student over their candidature develops many new skills, including: (i) advancing research ideas; (ii) conducting research; (iii) engaging with others about their research — locally and internationally; (iv) developing a profile as an independent researcher; and (v) developing their teaching portfolio. Ofcourse, a candidate is likely to encounter many highs and lows during their candidature. This tutorial will aim to introduce techniques to help advance the PhD process. It will empower attendees to share their own do’s and don’ts, review their practices for success, and refine productivity strategies. It will provide an impartial platform for an open and honest discussion about the PhD journey.</p>



                  	<h3>Workshops</h3>

                  <h4>BIRDS 2021—Bridging the Gap between Information Science, Information Retrieval and Data Science</h4>
                  <ul>
 						<li>Ingo Frommholz (University of Bedfordshire)</li>
 						<li>Haiming Liu (University of Bedfordshire)</li>
 						<li>Massimo Melucci (University of Padua)</li>
 					</ul>

                  <p>
                  	BIRDS — Bridging the Gap between Information Science, Information Retrieval and Data Science — aims to foster the cross-fertilization of Information Science (IS), Information Retrieval (IR), Human-computer Interaction (HCI) and Data Science (DS). Recognizing the commonalities and differences between these communities, the full-day workshop will bring together experts and researchers in IS, IR, HCI and DS to discuss how they can learn from each other to provide more human-driven data and information exploration and retrieval solutions. Therefore, we welcome submissions conveying interdisciplinary ideas on how to utilize, for instance, IS and HCI concepts and theories in IR and/or DS approaches to support users in data and information access, exploration and analysis.</p>

                  	<h4>Third Workshop on Evaluation of Personalisation in Information Retrieval (WEPIR 2021)</h4>
                  <ul>
 						<li>Gareth Jones (Dublin City University)</li>
 						<li>Nicholas Belkin (Rutgers University)</li>
 						<li>Noriko Kando (National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo)</li>
 						<li>Gabriella Pasi (University of Milando-Bicocca)</li>
 					</ul>

                  <p>
                  	The Third Workshop on Evaluation of Personalisation in Information Retrieval (WEPIR 2021) at CHIIR 2021 will bring together researchers interested in developing methods for the evaluation of personalisation in information retrieval. WEPIR 2021 will build on the successful previous WEPIRs at CHIIR 2018 and CHIIR 2019, and will have a strong emphasis on active participation by workshop attendees. The focus of WEPIR 2021 will be on the exploration of a number of specific use cases in the evaluation of personalisation in information retrieval. Workshop participants will be assigned to a breakout group to work together on the development of a method to address one of the use cases. Each group will seek to identify specific relevant factors relating to their use case in terms of factors including user activities, data to be collected, ethical issues, and evaluation metrics. Groups will share their findings in a final plenary session. The overall goal of the workshop is to work towards developing a general set of principles and guidelines for addressing the evaluation of specific instances of the use of personalisation in information retrieval tasks.</p>

                  	<h4>Future Conversations</h4>
                  <ul>
 						<li>Johanne Trippas (University of Melbourne)</li>
 						<li>Paul Thomas (Microsoft)</li>
 						<li>Damiano Spina (RMIT University)</li>
 						<li>Hideo Joho (University of Tsukuba)</li>
 					</ul>

                  <p>
                  	The Future Conversations workshop at CHIIR’21 looks to the future of search, recommendation, and information interaction to ask: where are the opportunities for conversational interactions? What do we need to do to get there? Furthermore, who stands to benefit? The workshop will be hands-on and interactive. Rather than a series of technical talks, we are soliciting position statements on opportunities, problems, and solutions in conversational search in all modalities (written, spoken, or multimodal). Each attendee will have the chance to write a position statement, and each statement will be critiqued by another attendee to kick-start the discussion.</p>
