                  <h2>Call for Workshop Proposals</h2>

                  <p>CHIIR 2021 is pleased to invite proposals for satellite workshops to be held in conjunction with the main conference.</p>
                  <p>CHIIR 2021 workshops will provide a platform for presenting novel ideas and emerging areas in Interactive IR, Information Seeking or Interfaces for Information Access in a less formal and potentially more focused way than the conference itself. Workshop topics typically match those identified in the CHIIR 2021 general call for contributions, but proposals related to other areas of Human Information Interaction and Interactive Information Retrieval  are welcome as well. The format of each workshop is to be determined by the organisers and can be either full-day or half-day. We encourage workshops that foster collaboration, discussion, group problem-solving and community building initiatives. Workshops that only revolve around the presentation of papers in a "mini conference" format are discouraged.</p>
                  <p>Researchers and practitioners from IR, HCI, Information Science or any related discipline are invited to submit proposals for review. The organisers of approved workshops will be expected to define the workshop’s focus, gather and review submissions, and decide upon the final program content. At least two organizers are expected to attend the entire workshop.</p>

                  <h3>Proposal Format &amp; Submission</h3>

                  <p>The workshop proposal should be one or two PDFs with the following parts:</p>

                  <ul>
                      <li>
                          A two page maximum extended abstract in CHIIR 2021 conference format including:
                          <ul>
                              <li>the title of the proposed workshop and format (full or half day)</li>
                              <li>the academic background for the work, including how it relates to CHIIR</li>
                              <li>the key outcomes or learnings</li>
                              <li>a short bio of each organizer or presenter, including their name, affiliation, email address, and website</li>

                              <li>a website URL (doesn't need to be active until after acceptance)</li>
